TL;DR:  In Google Reader, move the link icons on the right next to their
stars on the left.

I have a couple of reading modes in Google Reader.

Commuting to/from work and reading on my phone, I'll usually not expand any
posts and simply mark with a star which ones I'd like to read later.  After
that, I simply mark-as-read everything in that feed so I know what's new
when I return.

Later on when I'm at a larger screen I'll view my "Starred items".  Now, I
open each of the items in its own tab and remove the star to indicate that
I've read the item.

However, I find it tedious to have to either open the item, then click on
the title to open a new tab for it, OR move my mouse aaaaaaallllllll the way
over to the right to click the icon to open the item in a new tab.  If I'm
on a widescreen monitor, the item title and the open-icon are very far apart
and it's not always obvious at a quick glance which item's icon you are
clicking on.  Putting them next to each other means a lot less movement.

Caveat emptor:  whenever Google Reader is updated, be prepared for this
script to stop working.
